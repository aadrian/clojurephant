## What is this?

A Gradle plugin providing support for the Clojure and Clojurescript languages.

### Current Features

_Coming soon_

## Why should do you care?

The goal is to provide the same creature comforts that [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/) do for Clojure/Clojurescript development, while also leveraging Gradle's unique features:

- Strong support for polyglot projects
- Strong support for multi-project builds
- Large [plugin ecosystem](https://plugins.gradle.org)

## Usage

See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/gradle-clojure/gradle-clojure/releases) for available versions, compatibility with Gradle, Java, and Clojure, and detailed change notes.

_Coming soon_

## Acknowledgements

This project started from the [cursive.clojure](https://github.com/cursive-ide/gradle-clojure) plugin by Colin Fleming (@cmf, original author) and Piotrek Bzdyl (@pbzdyl).

Also thanks to John Szakmeister (@jszakmeister) for organizing a call with Gradle to get us started in the right direction.

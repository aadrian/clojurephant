## Expected Behavior

<!-- If you're reporting a bug, explain what should have happened -->

## Current Behavior

<!-- If you're reporting a bug, what happened instead of expected behavior -->

<!--
  Helpful flags for providing detailed output:
    --console=plain (provides all tasks and output that were executed)
    --stacktrace (if you have an error)
    --info (if something mildly bad happens)
    --debug (if something really bad happens)
-->

## Context

<!-- How does this bug impact your workflow? i.e. What's the value? -->
<!-- Link to any relevant discussions in other issues or forums, as applicable -->

## Steps to reproduce

<!-- If reporting a bug, provide steps to recreate and ideally a reproducible sample project -->

## Environment

<!-- A build scan -- https://scans.gradle.com/get-started -- is an ideal way to provide environment info -->
<!-- If a build scan isn't feasible, the output of ./gradlew --version can be used for all but the clojurephant version -->

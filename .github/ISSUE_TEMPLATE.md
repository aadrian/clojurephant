## Expected Behavior (Bugs or Features)

<!-- If you're reporting a bug, explain what should have happened -->
<!-- If you're suggesting a feature, how should it work? -->

## Current Behavior (Bugs)

<!-- If you're reporting a bug, what happened instead of expected behavior -->

<!--
  Helpful flags for providing detailed output:
    --console=plain (provides all tasks and output that were executed)
    --stacktrace (if you have an error)
    --info (if something mildly bad happens)
    --debug (if something really bad happens)
-->

## Context (Bugs and Features)

<!-- How does this bug or feature impact your workflow? i.e. What's the value? -->
<!-- Link to any relevant discussions in other issues or forums, as applicable -->

## Steps to reproduce (Bugs)

<!-- If reporting a bug, provide steps to recreate and ideally a reproducible sample project -->

## Environment (Bugs)

<!-- A build scan -- https://scans.gradle.com/get-started -- is an ideal way to provide environment info -->
<!-- If a build scan isn't feasible, the output of ./gradlew --version can be used for all but the gradle-clojure version -->

- **Build scan URL:**
- **gradle-clojure version:**
- **Gradle version:**
- **Java version:**
- **OS version:**
